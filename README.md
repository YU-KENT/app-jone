#Jone is a digital management platform dedicated to development teams. My goal is to make the developer's job easier and clearer. With this app, you can easily find all your projects, any requests, or new missions related to these projects. 
#For developers, their work becomes more efficient and streamlined. Requirements, tasks, and defects are unified, allowing for flexible switching between Kanban and list views. 
#As a leader, you can understand the current project status of the team, predict risks, and effectively control any problems that may arise during the project delivery process. This enables early judgments and timely intervention."
